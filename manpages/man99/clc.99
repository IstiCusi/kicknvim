    ADC #$20     ; Add 0x20 to accumulator with cleared carry
.fi

- CLC is typically used before ADC (Add with Carry) to ensure accurate addition without unintended carry from previous operations.
- It is also used before multi-byte addition routines to clear the carry flag before starting the addition process.
