.TH BMI 99 "June 2025" "MOS 6502 Instruction Set" "Kick'N'Vim Manual"

.SH NAME
bmi \- Branch if Minus (Negative flag set)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bmi
\fIrelative-address\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
BMI (Branch if Minus) is a conditional branch instruction of the MOS 6502 processor. It causes the program counter (PC) to jump to a new location if the negative flag (N) is set (i.e., equals one).

This instruction is typically used after operations that affect the negative flag, such as arithmetic or logical instructions, allowing conditional control flow based on the sign of the result.

The branch offset is an 8-bit signed value ranging from -128 to +127 bytes, relative to the address of the instruction following BMI.

.SH OPCODE
.TS
l l l l.
Addressing Mode	Opcode	Bytes	Cycles
Relative	$30	2	2 (+1 if branch taken, +1 if page crossed)
.TE

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.TP
None.
BMI only checks the negative flag but does not modify any processor status flags.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Conditional branch
.nf
    LDA #$FF     ; Load -1 into accumulator (sets N flag)
    BMI negative ; Branch if negative flag is set

    ; code for non-negative result continues here

negative:
    ; code for negative result
.fi

.SH NOTES
- BMI is commonly used after arithmetic or logical operations to branch based on the sign of the result.
- If the branch crosses a page boundary, the CPU requires one extra cycle.
- The target must be within -128 to +127 bytes of the instruction following BMI.
