.TH CPY 99 "June 2025" "MOS 6502 Instruction Set" "Kick'N'Vim Manual"

.SH NAME
cpy \- Compare Y Register with Memory

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cpy
\fIvalue\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
CPY (Compare Y Register) compares the contents of the Y index register with a specified value or memory location. It performs a subtraction of the operand from the Y register without storing the result; only the processor status flags are affected.

This instruction is useful for making decisions based on the comparison of the Y register with another value. After execution, the Zero (Z), Negative (N), and Carry (C) flags are set according to the result, allowing for conditional branching.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.TP
.B N
Set if the result of the subtraction has bit 7 set (i.e., result is negative).
.TP
.B Z
Set if the result of the subtraction is zero (i.e., Y register equals operand).
.TP
.B C
Set if the Y register is greater than or equal to the operand; cleared if less.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Compare Y register with immediate value
.nf
    LDY #$10     ; Load 0x10 into Y register
    CPY #$10     ; Compare Y register with 0x10
    BEQ equal    ; Branch if equal

equal:
    ; Code for equal case
.fi

.TP
.B Compare Y register with memory value
.nf
    LDY #$20     ; Load 0x20 into Y register
    CPY $00FF    ; Compare Y register with value at memory address $00FF
    BCC less     ; Branch if Y register is less than memory value

less:
    ; Code for less-than case
.fi

.SH NOTES
- CPY is functionally similar to performing a subtraction (Y - M) without storing the result.
- The instruction affects the processor status flags, which can be used with conditional branch instructions like BEQ, BNE, BCC, and BCS to control program flow.
- When comparing unsigned values:
  - If Y >= M, the Carry flag is set.
  - If Y < M, the Carry flag is cleared.
- For signed comparisons, additional logic is required as the CPY instruction does not account for signed overflow.
