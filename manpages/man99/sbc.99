.SH DESCRIPTION
The SBC (Subtract with Carry) instruction subtracts a memory value and the inverse of the carry flag from the accumulator.

It performs A := A - M - (1 - C), where:
- A = accumulator
- M = memory value

The result is stored back in the accumulator, and the processor status flags are updated accordingly.
