.TH DEC 99 "June 2025" "MOS 6502 Instruction Set" "Kick'N'Vim Manual"

.SH NAME
dec \- Decrement Memory

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dec
\fIaddress\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
DEC (Decrement Memory) is an instruction of the MOS 6502 processor that subtracts one from the value stored at a specified memory location. The result wraps around if it underflows:
- If the value is 0x00, decrementing wraps it to 0xFF.
- For signed values, decrementing 0x80 (-128) wraps to 0x7F (+127).

This instruction is useful for implementing countdown loops or adjusting memory-stored counters.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.TP
.B N
Set if the result has bit 7 set (i.e., result is negative).
.TP
.B Z
Set if the result is zero; cleared otherwise.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Decrement a memory location
.nf
    LDA $10      ; Load value from address $10
    DEC $10      ; Decrement value at address $10
    BEQ zero     ; Branch if result is zero

zero:
    ; Handle zero case
.fi

.TP
.B Decrement with indexing
.nf
    LDX #$05
    DEC $20,X    ; Decrement value at address $20 + X
.fi

.SH NOTES
- DEC does not affect the Carry (C) or Overflow (V) flags.
- It operates directly on memory; to decrement a register, use DEX or DEY.
- For indirect addressing modes, consider using the undocumented DCP instruction, which combines DEC and CMP operations.
