.TH LDX 99 "June 2025" "MOS 6502 Instruction Set" "Kick'N'Vim Manual"

.SH NAME
ldx \- Load X Register with Memory

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ldx
\fIvalue\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
LDX (Load X Register) loads a byte of memory into the X register. It affects the Zero and Negative flags based on the result.

.SH OPCODES
.TS
l l l l.
Addressing Mode	Opcode	Bytes	Cycles
Immediate	$A2	2	2
Zero Page	$A6	2	3
Zero Page,Y	$B6	2	4
Absolute	$AE	3	4
Absolute,Y	$BE	3	4 (+1 if page crossed)
.TE

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.TP
.B N
Set if bit 7 of the result is set; cleared otherwise.
.TP
.B Z
Set if the result is zero; cleared otherwise.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Load immediate value into X register
.nf
    LDX #$10     ; Load hexadecimal 10 into X register
.fi

.TP
.B Load value from zero page
.nf
    LDX $00      ; Load value from address $00 into X register
.fi

.TP
.B Load value using absolute,Y addressing
.nf
    LDY #$04
    LDX $1000,Y  ; Load value from address $1000 + Y into X register
.fi

.SH NOTES
- LDX is used to load a value into the X register from memory or immediate value.
- The choice of addressing mode affects the instruction's length and execution time.
- Indexed addressing modes are useful for accessing arrays and data structures.
- Unlike LDA, LDX supports Zero Page,Y and Absolute,Y addressing modes.
