.SH NAME
lda \- Load Accumulator with Memory

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lda
\fIaddressing-mode\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
LDA (Load Accumulator) is an instruction of the MOS 6502 processor that loads a byte from memory into the accumulator (A register). The value is copied and does not alter the source. The previous content of the accumulator is replaced.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.TP
.B Negative (N)
Set if bit 7 of the loaded value is 1.

.TP
.B Zero (Z)
Set if the loaded value is zero.

.SH ADDRESSING MODES
.TP
.B Immediate
lda #$10
.br
Loads the constant value $10 directly into the accumulator.

.TP
.B Zero Page
lda $10
.br
Loads the value from memory address $0010.

.TP
.B Zero Page,X
lda $10,x
.br
Adds register X to $10 and loads from the resulting zero-page address.

.TP
.B Absolute
lda $1234
.br
Loads the value from memory address $1234.

.TP
.B Absolute,X
lda $1234,x
.br
Adds register X to $1234 and loads from the resulting address.

.TP
.B Absolute,Y
lda $1234,y
.br
Adds register Y to $1234 and loads from the resulting address.

.TP
.B (Indirect,X)
lda ($10,x)
.br
Adds X to $10, looks up the resulting zero-page address as a 16-bit pointer, and loads the value it points to.

.TP
.B (Indirect),Y
lda ($10),y
.br
Looks up the zero-page address $10 as a 16-bit pointer, adds Y, and loads from the resulting address.
