.TH SEI 99 "June 2025" "MOS 6502 Instruction Set" "Kick'N'Vim Manual"

.SH NAME
sei \- Set Interrupt Disable Flag

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sei

.SH DESCRIPTION
SEI (Set Interrupt disable) is an instruction of the MOS 6502 processor that sets the interrupt disable flag (I) in the processor status register. When this flag is set, maskable IRQ interrupts are ignored. Non-maskable interrupts (NMIs) and reset signals still function normally.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.B I  
Set to 1 (disable IRQ interrupts).

.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
    SEI           ; Disable further IRQ interrupts
    ; Critical code here – interrupts are masked
    CLI           ; Re-enable interrupts when done
.fi

.SH NOTES
- Often used to protect critical sections or interrupt routines.
- A pending interrupt may still trigger after the next instruction—it's not affected by SEI executed within two cycles of the interrupt instruction.
- Use RTI to restore interrupt enable state when exiting an interrupt service routine.
