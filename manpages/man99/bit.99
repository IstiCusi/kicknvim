.TH BIT 99 "June 2025" "MOS 6502 Instruction Set" "Kick'N'Vim Manual"

.SH NAME
bit \- Bit Test

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bit
\fIaddress\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
BIT (Bit Test) is a non-destructive instruction of the MOS 6502 processor. It performs a bitwise AND between the accumulator and a memory operand, setting the zero flag (Z) accordingly, and transfers bits 7 and 6 of the operand into the negative (N) and overflow (V) flags, respectively.

This instruction is useful for testing specific bits in a memory location without altering the accumulator's value.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.TP
.B N
Set to bit 7 of the memory operand.
.TP
.B V
Set to bit 6 of the memory operand.
.TP
.B Z
Set if the result of A AND M is zero.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Test bit 7 (negative flag)
.nf
    LDA #$80     ; Load accumulator with 10000000b
    BIT $00FF    ; Test bit 7 of memory at $00FF
    BPL skip     ; Branch if bit 7 is clear (N=0)
.fi

.TP
.B Test bit 6 (overflow flag)
.nf
    BIT $00FF    ; Test bit 6 of memory at $00FF
    BVC skip     ; Branch if bit 6 is clear (V=0)
.fi

.TP
.B Test specific bits with accumulator mask
.nf
    LDA #%00001100  ; Mask to test bits 2 and 3
    BIT $00FF       ; Test bits 2 and 3 of memory at $00FF
    BEQ skip        ; Branch if both bits are clear
.fi

.SH NOTES
- BIT is commonly used to test status bits in memory-mapped I/O registers.
- The instruction does not modify the accumulator or the memory operand.
- Only the N, V, and Z flags are affected; other flags remain unchanged.
