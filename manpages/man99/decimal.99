.TH DECIMAL 99 "June 2025" "MOS 6502 Instruction Set" "Kick'N'Vim Manual"

.SH NAME
decimal \- Decimal Mode Flag (D flag)

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Decimal Mode Flag (D flag) in the 6502 processor determines whether arithmetic operations are performed in binary or Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) mode. When the D flag is set, the processor performs arithmetic operations using BCD, which is useful for applications requiring precise decimal calculations, such as financial computations.

.SH SETTING AND CLEARING THE D FLAG
.TP
.B SED
Set Decimal Mode: Sets the D flag to enable BCD arithmetic.
.TP
.B CLD
Clear Decimal Mode: Clears the D flag to return to binary arithmetic.

.SH EFFECT ON INSTRUCTIONS
The D flag affects the following instructions:
.TP
.B ADC
Add with Carry: Performs BCD addition when D flag is set.
.TP
.B SBC
Subtract with Borrow: Performs BCD subtraction when D flag is set.

Other instructions are unaffected by the state of the D flag.

.SH BEHAVIOR IN DECIMAL MODE
In BCD mode, each byte is treated as two decimal digits:
- The lower 4 bits represent the units digit (0–9).
- The upper 4 bits represent the tens digit (0–9).

For example, the byte 0x45 represents the decimal number 45.

When performing ADC or SBC in decimal mode, the processor adjusts the result to ensure each digit is a valid decimal digit (0–9). This adjustment may affect the Carry flag.

.SH INTERRUPT BEHAVIOR
On the original NMOS 6502:
- The D flag is not automatically cleared on interrupt or reset.
- Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) should explicitly clear the D flag using CLD to prevent unintended BCD operations.

On the CMOS 65C02 and later:
- The D flag is automatically cleared on interrupt and reset, reducing the need for explicit CLD in ISRs.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
In decimal mode, the behavior of certain flags may differ:
- The Carry (C) flag is set if the result exceeds 99 (BCD).
- The Zero (Z) and Negative (N) flags may not reflect the correct status after BCD operations on the NMOS 6502.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Perform BCD addition
.nf
    SED          ; Set Decimal Mode
    CLC          ; Clear Carry
    LDA #$45     ; Load 45 into accumulator
    ADC #$27     ; Add 27 (BCD)
    CLD          ; Clear Decimal Mode
.fi

After execution, the accumulator contains 0x72 (decimal 72), and the Carry flag is set if there was a carry out of the most significant digit.

.SH NOTES
- BCD mode is primarily used for applications requiring precise decimal arithmetic.
- The D flag should be managed carefully to avoid unintended behavior, especially on the NMOS 6502.
- Some systems, like the Commodore 64, automatically clear the D flag on startup.
