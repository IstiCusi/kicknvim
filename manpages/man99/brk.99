.TH BRK 99 "June 2025" "MOS 6502 Instruction Set" "Kick'N'Vim Manual"

.SH NAME
brk \- Software Interrupt (Break)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B brk

.SH DESCRIPTION
BRK (Break) is a software interrupt instruction of the MOS 6502 processor. It causes the processor to perform an interrupt sequence similar to a hardware interrupt, allowing the program to transfer control to an interrupt handler.

Upon execution, BRK performs the following operations:

1. Increments the program counter (PC) by two.
2. Pushes the high and low bytes of the incremented PC onto the stack.
3. Pushes the processor status register (with the break flag set) onto the stack.
4. Sets the interrupt disable flag (I).
5. Loads the interrupt vector from memory addresses $FFFE (low byte) and $FFFF (high byte) into the PC, transferring control to the interrupt handler.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED

Set in the copy of the status register pushed to the stack.

Set to disable further interrupts.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
    BRK          ; Invoke the interrupt handler at address stored in $FFFE/$FFFF
.fi

.SH NOTES
- BRK is commonly used for debugging purposes or to invoke system routines.
- The byte following the BRK instruction is often used as a signature or identifier, although BRK itself is a one-byte instruction.
- The return address pushed onto the stack points to the byte after the signature byte, requiring special handling in the interrupt routine if the signature is to be used.
