.TH BVS 99 "June 2025" "MOS 6502 Instruction Set" "Kick'N'Vim Manual"

.SH NAME
bvs \- Branch if Overflow Set

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bvs
\fIrelative-address\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
BVS (Branch if Overflow Set) is a conditional branch instruction of the MOS 6502 processor. It causes the program counter (PC) to jump to a new location if the overflow flag (V) is set (i.e., equals one).

This instruction is typically used after arithmetic operations that may affect the overflow flag, allowing conditional control flow based on the occurrence of signed overflow.

The branch offset is an 8-bit signed value ranging from -128 to +127 bytes, relative to the address of the instruction following BVS.

.SH OPCODE
.TS
l l l l.
Addressing Mode	Opcode	Bytes	Cycles
Relative	$70	2	2 (+1 if branch taken, +1 if page crossed)
.TE

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.TP
None.
BVS only checks the overflow flag but does not modify any processor status flags.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Conditional branch
.nf
    CLC          ; Clear carry flag
    ADC #$40     ; Add 0x40 to accumulator
    BVS overflow ; Branch if overflow flag is set

    ; code for no overflow continues here

overflow:
    ; code for overflow occurred
.fi

.SH NOTES
- BVS is commonly used after ADC or SBC instructions to branch based on the occurrence of signed overflow.
- If the branch crosses a page boundary, the CPU requires one extra cycle.
- The target must be within -128 to +127 bytes of the instruction following BVS.
