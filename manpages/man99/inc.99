.TH INC 99 "June 2025" "MOS 6502 Instruction Set" "Kick'N'Vim Manual"

.SH NAME
inc \- Increment Memory

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B inc
\fIaddress\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
INC (Increment Memory) is an instruction of the MOS 6502 processor that adds one to the value stored at a specified memory location. The result wraps around if it overflows:
- If the value is 0xFF, incrementing wraps it to 0x00.
- For signed values, incrementing 0x7F (+127) wraps to 0x80 (-128).

This instruction is useful for implementing counters, loops, or adjusting memory-stored values.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.TP
.B N
Set if the result has bit 7 set (i.e., result is negative).
.TP
.B Z
Set if the result is zero; cleared otherwise.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Increment a memory location
.nf
    LDA $10      ; Load value from address $10
    INC $10      ; Increment value at address $10
    BEQ zero     ; Branch if result is zero

zero:
    ; Handle zero case
.fi

.TP
.B Increment with indexing
.nf
    LDX #$05
    INC $20,X    ; Increment value at address $20 + X
.fi

.SH NOTES
- INC does not affect the Carry (C) or Overflow (V) flags.
- It operates directly on memory; to increment a register, use INX or INY.
- For indirect addressing modes, consider using the undocumented ISB instruction, which combines INC and SBC operations.
