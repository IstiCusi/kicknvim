.TH DCP 99 "June 2025" "MOS 6502 Instruction Set" "Kick'N'Vim Manual"

.SH NAME
dcp \- Decrement Memory and Compare with Accumulator (Undocumented Opcode)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dcp
\fIaddress\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
DCP is an undocumented instruction of the MOS 6502 processor that combines the functionality of DEC (Decrement Memory) and CMP (Compare Accumulator with Memory) into a single operation. It decrements the value at the specified memory location by one and then compares the result with the accumulator, affecting the processor status flags accordingly.

This instruction is particularly useful for implementing certain operations more efficiently, such as decrementing a 16-bit pointer or performing combined decrement and compare operations in fewer cycles.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.TP
.B N
Set if the result of the comparison has bit 7 set (i.e., result is negative).
.TP
.B Z
Set if the result of the comparison is zero (i.e., accumulator equals memory value after decrement).
.TP
.B C
Set if the accumulator is greater than or equal to the memory value after decrement; cleared if less.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Decrementing a 16-bit pointer
.nf
    LDA #$FF
    DCP pointer       ; Decrease low byte and compare with A
    BNE skip
    DEC pointer+1     ; Decrease high byte if low byte underflowed
skip:
    ; Continue execution
.fi

This approach uses fewer cycles and bytes compared to separate DEC and CMP instructions.

.SH NOTES
- DCP is an undocumented opcode and may not be supported on all 6502 variants.
- Its behavior is consistent across many NMOS 6502 processors but is not guaranteed on CMOS versions like the 65C02.
- Use with caution, as relying on undocumented instructions can affect portability and compatibility.
