.TH LAX 99 "June 2025" "MOS 6502 Instruction Set" "Kick'N'Vim Manual"

.SH NAME
lax \- Load Accumulator and X Register (Undocumented Opcode)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lax
\fIaddress\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
LAX is an undocumented instruction of the MOS 6502 processor that loads a value from memory into both the accumulator (A) and the X register simultaneously. It effectively combines the functionality of LDA (Load Accumulator) and LDX (Load X Register) into a single instruction.

This instruction is particularly useful for initializing both A and X with the same value efficiently.

.SH OPCODES

Addressing Mode	Opcode	Bytes	Cycles
Immediate	$AB	2	2
Zero Page	$A7	2	3
Zero Page,Y	$B7	2	4

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.TP
.B N
Set if bit 7 of the loaded value is set; cleared otherwise.
.TP
.B Z
Set if the loaded value is zero; cleared otherwise.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Load value into A and X from memory
.nf
    LAX $10      ; Load value from address $10 into A and X
.fi

.TP
.B Initialize A and X with immediate value
.nf
    LAX #$FF     ; Load $FF into A and X
.fi

.SH NOTES
- LAX is an undocumented opcode and may not be supported on all 6502 variants.
- Its behavior is consistent across many NMOS 6502 processors but is not guaranteed on CMOS versions like the 65C02.
- Use with caution, as relying on undocumented instructions can affect portability and compatibility.
