.SH NAME
MOS6502 \- 8‑bit microprocessor by MOS Technology

.SH SYNOPSIS
Introduced in 1975, the MOS Technology 6502 is a compact, efficient, and cost-effective 8‑bit CPU that powered early home computers, game consoles, and embedded systems.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 6502 microprocessor was designed by Chuck Peddle and his team after leaving Motorola. It offered a full-featured architecture comparable to the Motorola 6800 at a price of only $25, making it one of the most influential chips in computing history.

Core architectural features:
- **Registers**: A (accumulator), X and Y (index), SP (stack pointer), P (status), and PC (program counter)
- **Address Bus**: 16-bit, enabling access to 64KB memory
- **Instruction Set**: 56 official instructions plus numerous unofficial opcodes
- **Addressing Modes**: 13 different modes including zero page, absolute, indexed, and indirect
- **Clock Speed**: Typically 1–3 MHz depending on the system
- **Instruction Efficiency**: Many operations execute in 2–3 cycles

.SH SYSTEMS THAT USED THE 6502
- Apple II
- Atari 2600, Atari 800
- Commodore PET, VIC-20, Commodore 64 (via 6510 variant)
- BBC Micro
- Nintendo Entertainment System (via Ricoh 2A03)

.SH LEGACY
The 6502 revolutionized the CPU market by offering high performance at low cost. It set the stage for affordable personal computing and influenced the design of many later CPUs.

Its architecture is still studied and used in embedded systems through CMOS successors like the WDC 65C02.
