.TH ISC 99 "June 2025" "MOS 6502 Instruction Set" "Kick'N'Vim Manual"

.SH NAME
isc \- Increment Memory and Subtract with Carry (Undocumented Opcode)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B isc
\fIaddress\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
ISC (Increment Memory and Subtract with Carry) is an undocumented instruction of the MOS 6502 processor that combines the functionality of INC (Increment Memory) and SBC (Subtract with Carry) into a single operation. It increments the value at the specified memory location by one and then subtracts the result, along with the carry flag, from the accumulator.

This instruction is particularly useful for implementing certain operations more efficiently, such as decrementing a 16-bit pointer or performing combined increment and subtraction operations in fewer cycles.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.TP
.B N
Set if the result of the subtraction has bit 7 set (i.e., result is negative).
.TP
.B V
Set if the subtraction results in an overflow.
.TP
.B Z
Set if the result of the subtraction is zero; cleared otherwise.
.TP
.B C
Set if the subtraction does not require a borrow; cleared if a borrow is needed.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Decrementing a 16-bit pointer
.nf
    LDA #$FF
    SEC
    ISC pointer       ; Increment memory at 'pointer', then subtract from A
    BNE skip
    DEC pointer+1     ; Decrease high byte if low byte underflowed
skip:
    ; Continue execution
.fi

This approach uses fewer cycles and bytes compared to separate INC and SBC instructions.

.SH NOTES
- ISC is an undocumented opcode and may not be supported on all 6502 variants.
- Its behavior is consistent across many NMOS 6502 processors but is not guaranteed on CMOS versions like the 65C02.
- Use with caution, as relying on undocumented instructions can affect portability and compatibility.
