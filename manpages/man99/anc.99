.SH NAME
anc \- AND Accumulator with Immediate and Move Bit 7 to Carry

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B anc
\fI#immediate\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
ANC is an undocumented instruction of the MOS 6502 processor. It performs a bitwise AND between the accumulator and an immediate value, stores the result in the accumulator, and then sets the carry flag to the same value as the new bit 7 (the sign bit) of the accumulator.

This instruction effectively combines the functionality of the AND and ASL instructions, but only affects the carry flag based on the result's sign.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.TP
.B Carry (C)
Set to the value of bit 7 of the result (i.e., the sign bit).

.TP
.B Zero (Z)
Set if the result is zero; cleared otherwise.

.TP
.B Negative (N)
Set if bit 7 of the result is set; cleared otherwise.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
    LDA #$FF      ; Load accumulator with $FF
    ANC #$0F      ; A = $FF AND $0F = $0F; bit 7 = 0; C = 0

    LDA #$80      ; Load accumulator with $80
    ANC #$FF      ; A = $80 AND $FF = $80; bit 7 = 1; C = 1
.fi

.SH NOTES
- ANC is an undocumented instruction and may not be supported on all 6502 variants.
- Its behavior is consistent on NMOS 6502 processors but may differ on CMOS versions like the 65C02.
- Use with caution in cross-platform applications.
